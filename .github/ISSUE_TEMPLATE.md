### Reporting Bugs/Errors

When reporting errors, 99% of the time log file output is required. Please post the log file as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and provide a link in the new issue.

Also please have a look at the docs of the [core dependency-check](https://github.com/dependency-check/DependencyCheck) library to understand how the library works before you report a bug:
* [How does dependency-check work?](http://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/internals.html)
* [How to read the report](http://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/thereport.html)
* [Suppressing False Positives](http://dependency-check.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/suppression.html)


### Reporting False Positives/Negatives

As `sbt-dependency-check` is just a wrapper for SBT around the awesome [core dependency-check](https://github.com/dependency-check/DependencyCheck) 
project please report false positives/negatives [issues](https://github.com/dependency-check/DependencyCheck/issues) there.
